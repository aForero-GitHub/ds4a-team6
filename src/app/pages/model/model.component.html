              Everything started from understanding the context and analyzing Christus Sinergiaâ€™s objective:
              predicting, based on risk factors, which patients would develop hypertension and which would not, That is,
              we wanted a binary result: the patient will suffer from hypertension or not, based on qualitative
              and quantitative categorical factors and non-categorical, numerical and continuous factors.<br>
              <br />
            </p>
            <p>
              Based on these characteristics, a Binomial Logistic Regression model was designed and trained, taking
              into account the Gender, BMI, Age, Weight, Glucose, Triglycerides and Total Cholesterol factors. This
              model allowed us to identify the significant variables to explain the final diagnosis. However, we found
              that the model was not entirely reliable.<br>

              <br />

              We then decided to develop a Random Forest algorithm that would take into account these variables,
              already defined as significant, but that would allow us to have a higher level of certainty. After several
              iterations, we decide this will be the model used to predict hypertension diagnoses in Christus Sinergia
              patients.<br>

              As can be seen, the BALLOZED ACCURACY of our random forest model is 94%, a result that we believe
              accurately meets the needs of creating an early diagnosis of hypertension, we have used a classification
              type model with 500 trees, which has allowed us to generate greater accuracy in classifying the diagnoses
              of patients as hypertensive or non-hypertensive.
